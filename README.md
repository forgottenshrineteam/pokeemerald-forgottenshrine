# pokeemerald-forgottenshrine

## What is the pokeemerald-forgottenshrine?

pokeemerald-forgottenshrine* is a Pokémon Emerald fangame featuring an expanded Pokédex, modern battle mechanics, and QoL enhancements.

## What features are included?

Highlights include:

-pokeemerald-expansion (https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) was used as a base, so you can expect all of its enhancements featured here.
-An expanded Hoenn dex, including all Gen 4 evolutions, plus some extra additions from future and past regions. All Hoenn Pokémon (including mythicals) are obtainable (unless i messed something up, which is a very real possibility).
-A new set of TMs designed around a casual, single player playthrough (mostly coverage moves, with some status and set-up moves thrown in). They're also reusable!
-Other miscellaneous QoL tweaks.

Full patchnotes and credits to be featured on the wiki.

## How can I play?

Once I am satisfied with the project, I plan to release an .isp patch to be applied to a (legally obtained/compiled) Pokémon Emerald rom.
In the meantime, you can follow the instructions at INSTALL.md to compile your own playable rom, simply replace "https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald" with "https://github.com/forgottenshrineteam/pokeemerald-forgottenshrine".



*Forgotten shrine not included.
